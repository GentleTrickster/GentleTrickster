## Hello there! (General Kenobi!..)

A tricky twenty two year old guy who likes to overcomplicate programming after finishing his secondary special.
Knows C# as well as anyone (maybe slightly better), dabbled in Python, skimmed over HTML, CSS, LUA and JavaScript.
Worked with C# for somewhere along four-and-a-half years (mostly boring stuff and a couple of personal projects that is left to gather the dust.)
Uses Windows 10 (daily), has experience with Linux
